<h2>Yukihide</h2>
<div class="intro">
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Yukihide, and I'm a software developer working in Tokyo,
        Japan.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've chosen a simple design for this website because of the amount of
        written content I wanted to include. It looks more plain than my
        previous websites, which can be found in the footnote.
